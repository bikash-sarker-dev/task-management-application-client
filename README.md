# Task Management Application (TMA)

### description:

This is a task management system. From here we can add a tax. Then we drag and drop it into the workable function. We have three fields. The first field is Today, the second field is In Progress, and the third is Right. These are the three columns I have. Inside these three columns, we can face up the cards that I have. If I start a touch, we can track and drop it to whatever stage it's at and get the job done.

### bullet points to feature your website.

- We can add, delete, and update a task from here.
- We can do our adding and deleting and any other work in real time and the output will also be given to me in real time.
- If we cannot use the app without logging in, we can only do one thing after completing the authentication process.
- Cards can be dragged and dropped at will into any of the three fields.
